Automake branches
=================


automake tree created by the import of automake-1.8.2, on 2004 January 15.



dev-nxg-20040116-add-fpp-support
--------------------------------

Branch tag applied to automake and autoconf. 

The patches for adding FPP support, originally announced by Martin Wilck on
<http://sources.redhat.com/ml/autoconf-patches/2000-07/msg00287.html>,
will be added on this branch, and then merged onto the main
development branch, with an appropriate merge tag added then.  I'll
keep this branch, however, and when debugging that support, I'll do
the fixes on this branch and remerge them.  That way, I keep these
patches separate from the main ones I'll apply, plus it'll be easy to
generate a patch to 1.8.2 for eventual submission to the
automake-patches list.

Both the autoconf and automake trees on this branch were tagged, as
autoconf-2-59-fpp1 and automake-1-8-2-fpp1 respectively, on
2004-January-21.  They were then merged onto the trunk, and the
branches then tagged with dev-nxg-20040116-add-fpp-support-MERGED

Similarly for ...-fpp2, -fpp3, -fpp4.



DEV-nxg-20040720-special-install
--------------------------------

I'm afraid I don't really know the status of this branch!  I presume it was
for the changes to STAR_SPECIAL_INSTALL_COMMAND, but I appear to have
done them on the trunk instead.  How ill-disciplined of me.

However
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0407&L=stardev&P=R15945&I=-1
gives a clue, and suggests that I may well have merged this at some
point in the past.  At any rate, the special-install stuff currently
works, so if there's anything left unmerged on this branch it's
probably best abandoned.



DEV-nxg-20040730-fix-ac-canonical
---------------------------------

Automake handling of AC_CANONICAL_* is wrong, I think.  Fix on this
branch, and the patch offered to automake-patches@gnu.org:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2004-07/msg00023.html
Merged onto trunk 2004 July 30.  Though the code itself didn't make it
into the automake tree, the test case did, and the bug was fixed, and
that fix hand-applied to automake.in.  Branch now abandoned.
